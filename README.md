# IR-Crack-detection
Crack Detection Based on Infrared thermography (IR) - PyTorch

## 1. Paper

## 2. Dataset
(1) This dataset is used for crack detection based on the three types of images: the visible image, infrared image, and fusion.

(2) The dataset also considers different conditions and periods, including single and multi cracks, thin and thick cracks, clean and rough backgrounds, light and dark backgrounds, and three periods in one day.

(3) Three periods were used to acquire data (images), including the morning (8:00 am), noon (12:00 pm), and dusk (5:00 pm)
